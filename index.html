    <h1>My dog Bruce is the best boy in the world, even when he smells</h1>
    <h2>He smells particularly bad right now</h2>

    <h3>These are his favorite things, in order</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing with other dogs</li>
      <li>Playing with sticks/balls</li>
      <li>Getting pet</li>
      <li>Eating</li>
      <li>Watching TV</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, despite his smell, Bruce is happy and that makes me happy</p>
